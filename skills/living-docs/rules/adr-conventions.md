# ADR Conventions (MADR-lite)

An Architecture Decision Record captures **one** decision: the context that forced it, the choice made, and the consequences accepted. ADRs are how a future reader understands *why* the code is the way it is — and why a tempting alternative was not taken.

## Format

Each ADR is an **OKF concept** (`type: ADR`) — see the `okf-knowledge-format` skill. Use a lightweight MADR structure — frontmatter plus three body sections, no ceremony:

- **`status` (frontmatter)** — `Proposed` | `Accepted` | `Superseded` | `Deprecated`. Lives in the YAML frontmatter, not a body line. Supersession is recorded with the `supersedes` / `superseded_by` frontmatter keys (NNNN).
- **Context** — the forces at play: the problem, constraints, and what made a decision necessary. Written so a newcomer understands the pressure without prior knowledge.
- **Decision** — the choice, stated in active voice ("We will…"). Specific and testable.
- **Consequences** — what becomes easier, what becomes harder, what is now forbidden. Include the trade-offs you are knowingly accepting, not just the upside.

See `templates/adr.md` for the skeleton.

## Rules

1. **One decision per ADR.** If you are recording two decisions, write two ADRs. Bundled decisions can't be superseded independently.
2. **Number sequentially, never reuse.** `docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-slug.md`. The number is permanent even after the ADR is superseded.
3. **Supersede, never delete or rewrite.** When a decision changes:
   - Set the old ADR's frontmatter `status: Superseded` and `superseded_by: NNNN` (do not edit its Decision/Context — that is history).
   - Write a new ADR with `supersedes: NNNN` that references the one it supersedes in its Context.
   - If the old ADR is only *partially* affected, annotate the affected section with a pointer to the new ADR rather than rewriting it.
4. **Record load-bearing rejections.** When a design candidate is rejected for a reason a future explorer would otherwise re-discover the hard way, that reason is an ADR. Skip ephemeral ("not worth it now") or self-evident reasons.
5. **Link the evidence.** If the decision rests on research, link the research artifact bundle-relative (`/research/<…>/report.md`). If it implements a requirement, link the PRD/issue.
6. **Name the fitness function for measurable characteristics.** When an ADR decides a measurable architecture characteristic (a latency budget, a dependency-direction rule, a coupling/granularity constraint), the Consequences section SHOULD name the **fitness function** that enforces it — the executable check (a test, a build/lint rule, an arch-unit assertion) that lives in the suite and fails when the characteristic is violated. The ADR records *why*; the fitness function keeps it true. A measurable decision without an instrument is a vibe (see `memory/lessons.md`).
7. **Index every ADR.** Add a row to `docs/adr/index.md` (OKF reserved listing — number, title, status). The index carries no frontmatter; the decision log is the listing plus each ADR's `status`/`superseded_by` frontmatter.

## Anti-patterns

- Editing an accepted ADR's Decision to reflect a new choice — that erases history. Supersede instead.
- "Status: Accepted" with an empty Consequences section — every decision has trade-offs; if you can't name them, the decision isn't understood yet.
- An ADR that restates the code. ADRs explain *why*, not *what*. The code says what.
- Re-litigating a decision an existing ADR already settled without marking the contradiction explicitly.
